# Building a GET API Lab

## Learning Goals

- Build an API to handle GET requests.

---

## Key Vocab

- **Application Programming Interface (API)**: a software application that
  allows two or more software applications to communicate with one another. Can
  be standalone or incorporated into a larger product.
- **HTTP Request Method**: assets of HTTP requests that tell the server which
  actions the client is attempting to perform on the located resource.
- **`GET`**: the most common HTTP request method. Signifies that the client is
  attempting to view the located resource.

---

## Instructions

This is a **test-driven lab**.

Run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies and `pipenv shell` to enter
your virtual environment before running your code.

```console
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```

Change into the `server` directory and configure the `FLASK_APP` and
`FLASK_RUN_PORT` environment variables:

```console
$ cd server
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5555
```

In this application, we'll be working on a JSON API to get a list of bakeries
and their baked goods. We have two models, bakeries and baked goods, that have a
one-to-many relationship. Here's what the ERD for these tables looks like:

![Bakeries ERD](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-3/sinatra-with-active-record-get-lab/bakeries-baked_goods-erd.png)

The commands `flask db init` and `flask db migrate` have already been run. Run
the following command to initialize the database from the existing migration
script:

```console
$ flask db upgrade head
```

Run the following command to seed the table with sample data:

```command
$ python seed.py
```

You can run the app and explore your API in the browser by using Flask command:

```console
$ flask run
```


- `GET /bakeries`: returns a list of JSON objects for all bakeries in the
  database.
- `GET /bakeries/<int:id>`: returns a single bakery as JSON with its baked goods
  nested in a list. Use the `id` from the URL to look up the correct bakery.
- `GET /baked_goods/by_price`: returns a list of baked goods as JSON, sorted by
  price in **descending** order. (**HINT**: how can you use SQLAlchemy to sort
  the baked goods in descending order?)
- `GET /baked_goods/most_expensive`: returns the single most expensive baked
  good as JSON. (**HINT**: how can you use SQLAlchemy to sort the baked goods in
  **descending** order _and_ limit the number of results?)

Once all of your tests are passing, commit and push your work using `git` to
submit.
